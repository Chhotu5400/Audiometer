# AUDIOMETER
**The audiometry project is a software application designed to address the assessment
of hearing ability, particularly for clinical and diagnostic purposes. Its primary
purpose is to perform audiometric testing, which involves measuring an individual's
hearing thresholds across various frequencies. This project aims to solve several key
problems and fulfill the following goals:**
## PURPOSE:
#### HEARING ASSESSMENT:
**The project's main purpose is to provide a platform for
conducting hearing assessments and audiometric tests, allowing healthcare
professionals to determine the hearing ability of patients.**

#### KEY FEATURES: 
* #### Frequency Threshold Testing:
**The application allows users to measure hearing
thresholds at different frequencies, typically ranging from 125 Hz to 8,000 Hz.
This feature is essential for diagnosing specific hearing impairments.**
* #### Audiogram Generation:
  **The project can generate visual representations of
audiograms, which display the results of hearing tests. Audiograms are crucial
for diagnosing hearing disorders.**
* #### Patient Records:
**The application facilitates the storage and retrieval of patient
records, ensuring easy access to historical hearing test data.**
#### Data Analysis:
**It offers tools for analyzing and interpreting audiometric data,
aiding in the diagnosis and treatment planning.**
#### Accessibility: 
**The software may include accessibility features to accommodate
individuals with hearing disabilities during the testing process.**
